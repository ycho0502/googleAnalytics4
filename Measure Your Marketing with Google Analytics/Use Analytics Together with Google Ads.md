#### Overview of Google Ads

Google Ads is Google's online advertising program, where you can reach new customers as they search for keywords related to your business or browse websites with related themes. Letâ€™s explore different ways you can reach customers using Google Ads.


#### Google Ads integration with Google Analytics

Use the tools available in the Google Ads interface to gain insight into how ads and campaigns are performing. To unlock more features and reporting, link your Google Ads account to your Google Analytics 4 (GA4) property.

###### **GA4 reports and explore**
Linking your GA4 property and Google Ads account will import your Google Ads data into your GA4 property. This data automatically generates campaign-related metrics (like clicks and cost) and dimensions (like campaign name) in Google Analytics. These metrics and dimensions are available throughout the reports and explore workspaces.

###### **Advertising workspace in GA4**
Linking your GA4 property and your Google Ads account unlocks features in the advertising workspace in Analytics. The reports in this workspace can provide a strong understanding of the return on investment of your media spend across all channels, help you evaluate attribution models, and make informed decisions about budget allocation in Google Ads.
