#### Give credit where credit is due

A customer may do several searches and interact with several ads before making a purchase or completing another valuable action on your website. Typically, credit for the conversion goes to the last ad a customer interacted with. But was it only that last ad that made them convert? What about the other ads they interacted with before it?

Attribution is the act of assigning credit for conversions to different ads, clicks, and factors along a user's path to completing a conversion. An attribution model can be a rule, a set of rules, or a data-driven algorithm that determines how credit for conversions is assigned to touchpoints on conversion paths. 


#### Ads-preferred last click model

Ads-preferred last click attributes 100% of the conversion value to the last Google Ads channel a customer interacted with before converting. If there's no Google Ads interaction in the path, as in Example 3, the attribution model falls back to cross-channel last click.

Examples
1.  Display > Social > Paid Search > Organic Search → 100% to Paid Search
2.  Display > Social > YouTube Engaged View > Email → 100% to YouTube
3.  Display > Social > Email > Direct → 100% to Email (fallback to last non-direct click)


#### Benefits of Data-Driven Attribution

- Free and easy-to-implement models enable consistent and deduplicated conversion measurement across platforms.
- Calibrated with incrementality signals to give credit to the ads most contributing to advertiser goals.
- When cross-channel export is available, seamless integration with Smart Bidding strategies in Google Ads for real-time optimization.



-   Customer journeys are becoming more complex. To keep up, businesses need measurement tools that can stitch together these fragmented journeys and provide actionable insights. 
-   Data-driven attribution distributes credit for the conversion based on observed data for each conversion type.
-    Use attribution reports to get a better understanding of how advertising efforts work together to drive conversions.
