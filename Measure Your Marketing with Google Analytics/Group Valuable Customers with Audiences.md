#### Audiences

Audiences let you segment users in ways that are important to your business. Segment by dimensions, metrics, and events to include nearly any subset of users.Â 

Use audiences in a number of ways:
-   Reporting in Analytics: Filter analytics reports by audiences you create
-   If using Google Ads, export audiences to use for ad targeting and bidding.
-   Trigger events when users match the definition of an audience and become members. Mark those events as conversions and use them for things like bidding in Google Ads.


#### Building your Audience

As you define your audience using any of those methods, the summary card updates with the number of users who met your criteria in the last 30 days, providing an idea of potential audience size.
Once you save your new audience, you can start using it in your reporting! As Analytics gets new data about users, their audience memberships are reevaluated to make sure they still meet the audience criteria. If the latest data indicates they no longer meet the criteria, they're removed from those audiences.
Note: Metrics in your report will count users who were active during the date range you set for the report (rather than the total number of users in the audience).
