## Reports and Explorations

- Reports and Explorations are complementary areas in the latest Google Analytics experience. They’re designed to provide actionable insights into your website and app data, so you can explore data and insights at the level you need, from technical analysis to high-level reporting.

#### Reports

- Summary reports
	- You’ll find many different reports listed on the left side of the Analytics interface. These reports can show you information about your users, like how they found your business and how they’re engaging with it. Each report shows a high-level snapshot of these insights using summary cards. 
	- If you want to go deeper into a particular topic, you can explore a more comprehensive report by selecting the link at the bottom of each summary card.
- Realtime report
	- With the Realtime report, you can monitor activity as it happens. This report shows you events that took place between five seconds and 30 minutes ago.
	- The card-based layout is designed to quickly answer important questions about how your users are currently interacting with your business. Each card represents a stage in the marketing funnel. In this report you can: 
		- See different segments of users side by side to compare how they’re performing in real time
		- Easily create a new segment that you can also use in other reports

#### Explorations

- Free form exploration
	- The free form exploration allows you to visualize your data with flexibility and ease. To conduct an ad hoc analysis, just drag and drop the variables you’re interested in onto a canvas to see instant visualizations of your data. Don’t see the variable you’re looking for? Select the plus icon to view the full list of dimensions and metrics you can use.
	- This tool presents your data in a cross-tab layout, where you can arrange the rows and columns as you like and add the metrics you're most interested in. You can also apply different visualization styles, including bar charts, pie charts, line charts, scatter plots, and maps.
	- If you spot a significant data point, right-click on that data point to easily create an audience or segment from it and use it in other explorations. If you use the line chart visualization, you’ll see an automatic feature enabled called anomaly detection. This feature uses machine learning to identify outliers in your data according to your parameters.
