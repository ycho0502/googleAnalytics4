## Reports and Explorations

- Reports and Explorations are complementary areas in the latest Google Analytics experience. They’re designed to provide actionable insights into your website and app data, so you can explore data and insights at the level you need, from technical analysis to high-level reporting.

#### Reports

- Summary reports
	- You’ll find many different reports listed on the left side of the Analytics interface. These reports can show you information about your users, like how they found your business and how they’re engaging with it. Each report shows a high-level snapshot of these insights using summary cards. 
	- If you want to go deeper into a particular topic, you can explore a more comprehensive report by selecting the link at the bottom of each summary card.
- Realtime report
	- With the Realtime report, you can monitor activity as it happens. This report shows you events that took place between five seconds and 30 minutes ago.
	- The card-based layout is designed to quickly answer important questions about how your users are currently interacting with your business. Each card represents a stage in the marketing funnel. In this report you can: 
		- See different segments of users side by side to compare how they’re performing in real time
		- Easily create a new segment that you can also use in other reports
