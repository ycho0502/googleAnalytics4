#### Free form

Free form presents your data in a cross-tab layout, where you can arrange the rows and columns as you like and add the metrics you're most interested in. You can also apply different visualization styles, including bar charts, pie charts, line charts, scatter plots, and maps. Don’t see the variable you’re looking for?

#### Funnel exploration

Funnel exploration lets you visualize the steps your users take toward a key task or conversion. This tool helps you identify sequences of key events and understand how your users navigate these steps. You'll be able to see where users enter your funnels, as well as where they drop off.

#### Path exploration

Path exploration lets you understand how people progress from one stage in the customer journey to the next. 

Like funnel exploration, path exploration explores the steps users take through your site or app. But while funnels only analyze a single, predefined path, path exploration is free-flowing and can follow any number of undefined paths, even ones you weren’t aware of or didn’t intend. For example, it could uncover looping behavior, which may indicate users becoming stuck.

#### Segment overlap

Segment overlap lets you compare up to three user segments to quickly see how those segments overlap and relate to each other. This can help you isolate specific audiences based on complex conditions. You can then create new segments based on your findings, which you can apply to other Analysis techniques and Google Analytics reports.

#### User lifetime

User lifetime can show how your users have behaved since they began interacting with your site or app. 

The user lifetime technique can help you find specific insights — for example, which traffic source drove users with the highest lifetime value, or which campaigns are acquiring users who are expected to be more valuable.

#### Cohort exploration

A cohort is a group of users who share a common characteristic identified in this report by a specific event the user has triggered. For example, all users who signed up last week for your newsletter belong to the same cohort. 

Cohort exploration lets you explore the behavior of these groups over time on your app or website. For example, it could tell you whether the cohort of users who subscribed to your newsletter last week convert more often than your other users.

#### Why data might look different between Reports and Explorations

Usually you should see the same data in both Reports and Explorations. But sometimes you may see differences in the data shown in each area. Here are a few reasons why:
-   **Metrics and dimensions:** Some metrics and dimensions available in Reports aren't supported in Explorations. So, when you open a report in Explorations that includes unsupported fields, those fields are dropped from the exploration.
-   **Sampling differences:** Reports are unsampled, meaning they're based on 100% of the available data. Explorations, on the other hand, may be based on sampled data if the dataset is very large.
-   **Processing time differences:** If you set your date range to include data from the past 48 hours, you may notice slightly different results depending on when the data is processed.
