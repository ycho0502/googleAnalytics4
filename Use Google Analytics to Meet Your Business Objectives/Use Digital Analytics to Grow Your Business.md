#### Why use digital analytics?

If you run a business that has an app or a website, you probably have a lot of questions about how your brand is performing, like:

	-   How are users interacting with your app or website? 
	-   How effective are your marketing campaigns? 
	-   Which content is helping you achieve your business goals?
	-   Where are your users coming from, and where on your site or app are they are leaving?

-   Digital analytics can help you understand how your customers are using your app or website so you can better meet your marketing goals.
-   Rising user expectations about privacy, more global regulations, and decreases in browser support for cookies have made digital measurement more challenging.
-   Google Analytics can help you and your business measure what you need to achieve your business objectives.
