#### Report snapshot

The Reports snapshot page gives you a summary of what’s interesting about your data. 

This card is a preview of a larger report. Most cards use data from larger Analytics reports, like conversions or events. 

A card can have up to three controls:
-   Dimension/metric picker
-   Date-range selector
-   Link to the associated report

**Dimension/metric picker:** If a card has dimension or metric pickers across the top, you can use them to change which data is displayed in the card. In this case, the dimension is User medium.

**Date range selector:** Use the date range selector in the upper right to choose the timeframe you want to report on.

**Link to associated report:** To open the associated report, select the link at the bottom right of the card. This will open a more in-depth report on the card topic.


#### The Realtime report

With the Realtime report, you can monitor activity as it happens. This report shows you events that took place within the last 30 minutes.

The card-based layout is designed to quickly answer important questions about how your users are currently interacting with your business. In this report you can: 
-   See whether a one-day promotion is driving traffic to your site or app
-   Monitor the immediate effects on traffic from a blog/social network post or tweet
-   Verify that the tracking code is working on your site or app


#### The rest of the default reports

The rest of the default reports all have the same basic format. To see these reports, click the links on the left side of the Analytics interface. Here are all the reporting categories along with a brief explanation of the questions they answer:
-   **Acquisition**: Where are your customers coming from?
-   **Engagement**: Which content are your customers engaging with?
-   **Monetization**: What is your customers' shopping activity?
-   **Retention**: Are your customers coming back?
-   **Demographics**: Who are your customers?
-   **Tech**: What technology are your customers using?
